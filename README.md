# HumbleKeysLibrary
Humble Keys Library is a library plug-in extension for [Playnite](https://playnite.link/) which queries Humble Bundle for third-party keys.

The default Humble Library plug-in only reports DRM-free games, not the keys for third-party services like Steam. Humble Keys Library allows you to search your entire collection for a game, to make sure you don't buy a new copy in the latest sale if you already have one from a previous Humble Bundle.

## Installation
Download the latest .pext file and drag-and-drop it onto your Playnite window.
